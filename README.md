# forvorbiscomment

This is a script that interactively creates metadata for all of the .ogg files in a directory.

You should make sure the file called "forvorbiscomment" is executable with `chmod +x forvorbiscomment`.

You can also feel free to put this script in your PATH.

Feel free to fork this repository if you want to make changes (i.e., to make it work for other file types with a different program like an id3 tagger).

## Dependencies
- vorbis-tools (or whatever package provides vorbiscomment in your distro)
- bash (will probably not work with other shells)
