# forvorbiscomment

This is a script that interactively creates metadata for all of the .ogg files in a directory.

You should make sure the file called "forvorbiscomment" is executable with `chmod +x forvorbiscomment`.

You can also feel free to put this script in your PATH.

I didn't put comments in the code, but it does what I need it to (this is just a personal script I thought I'd put out publicly).

Feel free to fork this repository if you want to make changes (i.e., to make it work for other file types).
